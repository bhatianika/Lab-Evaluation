# Lab-Evaluation
Target : Target 5

# Best Model : Random Forest Regressor with 150 estimators

All the models that use some distance based metric have used a scaled dataset instead of the original dataset
Decision Tree and Random Forest used unscaled dataset

# Scaled Dataset 

Robust Scaling used, based on Median and InterQuartile Range
